1. create a virtual environmen in the directory you're going to start your project
    ex - if my project is going to be in the project directory then in the project
    directory -
    python3 -m venv env ( here env is the name of the virtual environment directory)
2. After you have created  a virtual environkent then you must activate it:
    source env/bin/activate
3. After activating the  virual environment you can use the django-admin command.
    Make sure you have installed django with the command - python -m django version
    Now run the command - django-admin startproject mysite
    This creates a new folder name mysite which is a django project
4. manage.py & settings.py
    These are some of the default files that come with the django project
    Inside your mysite directory you will have one more mysite directory and a 
    manage.py file. 
5. Now install django in the directory where mysite is stored using the command -
    pip install django
6. Try testing the django installation by going into the directory where manage.py
    is present. Then use the command - python manage.py runserver
7. Please refer the django documentation for troubleshooting.
